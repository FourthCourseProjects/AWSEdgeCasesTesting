The AWS Limits Testing Projects Repository is a comprehensive collection of projects designed to push the boundaries and test the limits of Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. Our goal is to explore and experiment with various AWS services, capabilities, and configurations to understand their thresholds, performance, and scalability.
